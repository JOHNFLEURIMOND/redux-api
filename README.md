# My Awesome Project
This application is a React Redux-Saga app that show a simple list of recent earthquakes.

## How It's Made:
This application is made with React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Axios, Webpack, and Babel. This was the first time I didnt use `create-react-app`

## Optimizations.
Finish the app, I want to see if I can use Redux & Redux-Saga in other apps
## Lessons Learned:
How to spin up your own webpack instead of useing create-react-app. Redux & Redux-Saga, actions, revolvers, sagas and how they handle state.
